# Counting-Collisions

An [interative/simulation](https://prajwalsouza.github.io/Experiments/Colliding-Blocks.html) inspired by an awesome [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs) by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw).

### Update (13th Feb 2019)

When special relativistic [equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_collision#One-dimensional_relativistic) for elastic collisions were taken into account, the constant energy curve isn't an ellipse at speeds close to the speed of light. It's more of a rounded rectangle. 

#### When mass m2 = 1000 and it's initial speed is 0.01c.
