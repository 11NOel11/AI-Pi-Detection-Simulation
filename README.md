# AI-Driven Discovery of Fundamental Constants in Physical Phenomena

## Introduction
Understanding the emergence of fundamental constants, such as \(\pi\), in physics has been a cornerstone of scientific inquiry. This project explores whether AI can autonomously detect and hypothesize mathematical structures underlying physical laws by analyzing numerical simulations. Precisely, our AI model successfully rediscovered pi from a classical mechanics simulation involving elastic collisions, and has also completely discovered the underlying relation that was the cause of the emergence of pi.

## Background and Theoretical Motivation
Physical constants such as pi, e, and h emerge in diverse contexts, from statistical mechanics to quantum field theory. This project draws inspiration from classical mechanics, particularly the problem of counting collisions between blocks with different mass ratios, where the number of collisions follows a pattern related to pi. Using machine learning techniques, we allow AI to process numerical data and propose functional relationships autonomously.

## Methodology
### Data Generation
We simulate elastic collisions of two blocks with varying mass ratios and count the total number of collisions before they separate indefinitely. The classical solution predicts that the number of collisions scales as pi times sqrt{m_2/m_1} for large mass ratios. For the visualisation of this emergence of pi, we have forked the repository  https://github.com/prajwalsouza/Counting-Collisions. His HTML website https://prajwalsouza.github.io/Experiments/Colliding-Blocks.html truly captures how pi comes out of nowhere.

### AI-Driven Pattern Recognition
We utilize symbolic regression techniques to extract underlying equations from the generated numerical data. The AI:
- Analyzes the dataset to identify relationships between variables.
- Constructs mathematical expressions to approximate the observed behavior.
- Simplifies expressions to reveal fundamental mathematical structures.

### Results
The AI successfully derived a function of the form:
$$
N \approx 3.141 \times 10^{X_0}
$$

Where $$X_0$$ represents a transformed mass ratio variable in the form of log(mass ratio). This approximation aligns with the expected presence of $$pi$$ in the theoretical solution.

## AI as a Theoretical Physicist or Mathematician
AI excels at recognizing patterns in large datasets, mirroring the process of human theoretical discovery. In this context, the AI acts as an automated theorist, autonomously deriving mathematical relationships from empirical observations. Unlike traditional numerical curve fitting, AI-driven symbolic regression enables the emergence of physically meaningful expressions.

A useful comparison is SANATA AI, which aims to derive new physical theories by searching for invariant structures within data. Unlike SANATA, which operates on more abstract theoretical principles, our approach focuses on direct symbolic extraction from simulated experiments, making it accessible for targeted applications in physics and mathematics. 

Extending to Other Physical Phenomena
The success of this approach highlights the potential for AI in uncovering hidden mathematical structures in nature. Future research could extend this methodology to a broader range of physical systems, including:

Discovering Constants in Chaotic Systems: Many chaotic systems exhibit underlying mathematical structures that are difficult to discern using traditional analytical methods. AI could be employed to identify fundamental constants governing these systems, providing insights into the deeper order within apparent randomness.

Exploring Quantum Mechanics for Emergent Symmetries in π Discovery: The presence of mathematical constants like π in quantum mechanics suggests deeper symmetries yet to be fully understood. AI models could be used to analyze wavefunctions, probability distributions, and quantum entanglement patterns to uncover how π and other constants emerge in quantum phenomena.

Investigating AI-Driven Hypotheses in Mathematical Structures of Physical Phenomena: Beyond numerical discovery, AI can assist in formulating new hypotheses about the mathematical foundations of physical laws. This includes analyzing large datasets from experiments, identifying recurring patterns, and proposing novel equations that govern natural processes. Such an approach could bridge gaps in theoretical physics and provide new perspectives on long-standing scientific questions. If an approach like this works connectivity of different physics fields and mathematics fields will increase, in turn leading to way more new and profound ways to understand the universe. By leveraging AI’s capability to process vast amounts of data and recognize intricate patterns beyond human intuition, researchers can uncover hidden relationships between seemingly unrelated physical phenomena. This could lead to advancements in areas such as quantum mechanics, general relativity, and complex systems analysis.

Moreover, AI-driven hypothesis generation may accelerate scientific discovery by proposing mathematically consistent models that can be further tested and refined by physicists. The synergy between AI and theoretical physics holds the potential to redefine how fundamental laws are discovered, ultimately transforming our understanding of reality.

By expanding this AI-driven methodology, we may move closer to unveiling the fundamental mathematical principles that govern the universe.

### AI-Guided Hypothesis Generation
Beyond rediscovering known results, AI may play a role in formulating new conjectures in physics. By training on diverse datasets, AI could surely generate plausible mathematical structures that human researchers can refine and validate, potentially accelerating breakthroughs in fundamental physics.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the feasibility of AI in autonomously detecting fundamental constants within physical simulations. By treating AI as an analytical tool akin to a theoretical physicist, we open the possibility of AI-driven scientific discovery. Future research will further refine these techniques, expanding AI's role in hypothesizing physical laws beyond known mathematical structures. This would most likely open up several closed gates to unsolved problems where the question surprisingly had a link to some native field of physics and maths, which might have been  invisible to human eyes.
